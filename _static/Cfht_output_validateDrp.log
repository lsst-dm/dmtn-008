Median value of the astrometric scatter - all magnitudes: 63.159 mas
Astrometric scatter (median) - mag < 21.0 : 11.4 mas
Median value of the photometric scatter - all magnitudes: 118.271 mmag
Photometric scatter (median) - mag < 21.0 : 14.3 mmag
No stars found that are 199.0--201.0 arcmin apart.
PA1(RMS) = 19.07+-0.00 mmag
PA1(IQR) = 20.86+-0.40 mmag
minimum: PF1=20% of diffs more than PA2 = 24.14 mmag (target is < 15 mmag)
design : PF1=10% of diffs more than PA2 = 30.27 mmag (target is < 15 mmag)
stretch: PF1= 5% of diffs more than PA2 = 36.26 mmag (target is < 10 mmag)
Median of distribution of RMS of distance of stellar pairs.
DESIGN goals
For stars from 17.00 < mag < 21.50
from D = [4.00, 6.00] arcmin, AM1=9.23 mas (target is < 10 mas).
  10.46% of sample deviates by >30 mas (target is < 10%)
