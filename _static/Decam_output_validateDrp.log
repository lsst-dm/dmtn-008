No stars found that are 199.0--201.0 arcmin apart.
PA1(RMS) = 40.15+-0.00 mmag
PA1(IQR) = 38.17+-0.48 mmag
minimum: PF1=20% of diffs more than PA2 = 46.62 mmag (target is < 15 mmag)
design : PF1=10% of diffs more than PA2 = 62.89 mmag (target is < 15 mmag)
stretch: PF1= 5% of diffs more than PA2 = 79.46 mmag (target is < 10 mmag)
Median of distribution of RMS of distance of stellar pairs.
DESIGN goals
For stars from 17.00 < mag < 21.50
from D = [4.00, 6.00] arcmin, AM1=29.15 mas (target is < 10 mas).
  48.77% of sample deviates by >30 mas (target is < 10%)
